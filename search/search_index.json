BikeCycle's purpose is to track the lifecycle of a bicycle through FreeRide from the time a bicycle is first donated, to when it leaves the shop. FreeRide FreeRide accepts donated bicycles in any condition. Volunteers evaluate the bikes, fix them donate them, or take them apart for metal recycling. Once a bike is fixed, it's donated or sold to the public at a drastically reduced price. Current Spreadsheets FreeRide currently uses two speadsheets to record bicycle information, an Incoming spreadsheet and an Outgoing spreadsheet. Incoming spreadsheet: When a bike is donated to the shop a unique number, known as the bikeID, is pasted to the frame. The bikeID and other basic information is entered into a form which automatically populates a spreadsheet named Incoming. An abbreviated example of the Incoming spreadsheet is below: Incoming Timestamp Make Model Wheel Size Bike ID 7/29/2022 10:12:14 Kent Ambush 20\" A0001 7/29/2022 10:12:54 Huffy Stone Mountain 20\" A0002 7/29/2022 10:13:32 Next Screamer II 20\" A0003 Outgoing spreadsheet: When a bicycle leaves the shop through a donation, sales, or recycling, the bikeID and destination are recorded using a form that populates a spreadsheet named Outgoing. | Outgoing | | | ------------|---------------------- | | Bike ID | Outgoing Destination | | A0069 | Volunteer | | A0301 | Sold | | A0302 | Communicycle | Proposed Spreadsheet BikeCycle spreadsheet: I was asked to take the two existing spreadsheets, Incoming and Outgoing, and create a third spreadsheet named BikeCycle. The BikeCycle spreadsheet links the Incoming spreadsheet to the Outgoing spreadsheet using the bikeID. When a bike is leaving the shop and the bikeID is entered into the Outgoing form, the information associated with that bikeID, that was captured on the Incoming spreadsheet, will automatically show up in BikeCycle. This will allow the user to see all the data for that bike in one place. BikeCycle bikeId Outgoing Destination Timestamp Make Model Wheel Size Bike number A0069 Volunteer 7/29/2022 10:12:14 Kent Ambush 20\" A0001 A0069 Volunteer 7/29/2022 10:12:54 Huffy Stone Mountain 20\" A0002 A0069 Volunteer 7/29/2022 10:13:32 Next Screamer II 20\" A0003 The Challenges There were a few challenges to overcome to complete this project. The two original sheets are in seperate files. The lookup column in the Incoming spreadsheet, BikeId, is not the first column in the sheet. This presents challenges for the common spreadsheet formula VLOOKUP() which requires that the lookup field be to the left of any fields returned by the search. Note: There are other spreadsheet options that can be used, but this is a showcase of my VLOOKUP() skills. Other options include: INDEX() / MATCH() QUERY() XLOOKUP() Add-ons such as Consolidate Sheets or Merge Sheets The Solution The solution to this challenge, using VLOOKUP(), is to use a combination of IMPORTRANGE() and VLOOKUP() in a new spreadsheet. IMPORTRANGE() is used to import the Outgoing data (Date, BikeId, Destination) to the BikeCycle spreadsheet. VLOOKUP() is used to search for the corresponding Bicycle attributes in the Incoming spreadsheet using the BikeID as the lookup field. Let's take a look at how we got around the VLOOKUP() limitation that requires the lookup field to be in the left most column. If you remember, the bikeId on the Incoming spreadsheet occurs well into the spreadsheet column list and definitely not to the left of the information we want VLOOKUP() to return. Incoming Timestamp Make Model Wheel Size Bike ID 7/29/2022 10:12:14 Kent Ambush 20\" A0001 To avoid the limitations of VLOOKUP() we use the following formula to trick it into using the bikeId. ArrayFormula(IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A2,{Incoming!H2,Incoming!A2:J},{2,3,4,5,6,7,9},False),\"\")) Don't panic! We're going to deconstruct this formula into it's individual parts and explain what each part is doing. First, let's highlight the VLOOKUP() part of this formula. ArrayFormula(IFERROR( VLOOKUP(A2,{Incoming!H2,Incoming!A2:J},{2,3,4,5,6,7,9},False) ,\"\")) Next we look at the VLOOKUP() syntax and compare it to the VLOOKUP() in our formula. The Microsoft documentation for Excel defines the syntax for VLOOKUP() as: VLOOKUP(lookup_value,table_array,col_index_num,[range_lookup]) In the syntax above, the lookup_value is the search term we are trying to find. The table_array is where we expect to find this term and it's related values. The col_index_num is the column or columns we want to return. The [range_lookup] is optional and specifies, depending on who you ask, whether this is a text or numeric field (numeric is the default, choose False for text). The table below gives a description of this syntax and shows the values we entered for each part. VLOOKUP() lookup_value table_array col_index_num [range_lookup] Description What to look for Where to look what to return optional options Our version A2 {Incoming!H2,Incoming!A2:J} {2,3,4,5,6,7,9} False More to come....
