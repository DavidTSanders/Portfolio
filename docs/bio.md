David Sanders is a life-long learner who is looking forward to starting this new phase of his life
as a Data Analyst. He has a B.A. in Media Arts and is currently a self-guided student,
completing his second online course in Graphical Information Science (GIS) with the University
of Helsinki’s Department of Geosciences. He is also preparing for the Google Analytics
Professional Certificate.


David’s most recent job was working with the Pittsburgh Compost Company where he was
responsible for collecting, weighing and reporting on compost from large commercial kitchens
such as the University of Pittsburgh, UPMC, PNC, and Facebook. Unfortunately the Pittsburgh
Composting Company stopped doing business as of August 31st 2022.


Over the course of his career, David Sanders has worked as a Computer Programmer, Teacher,
Legal Videographer, Performer and Laborer.


His work philosophy is to be curious and look for deeper meaning behind a request or task. He
believes knowing why a project is important to a company, department and/or client, and how it
fits into the bigger picture, leads to a better understanding of the details involved and a more
comprehensive solution.


His professional achievements include: 

- Helping one of Merrill Lynch’s global intranet web sites transition from being dependent
on outside vendors, to successful in-house development of internal applications. He also
helped to plan and implement QA and Staging environments. 

- Videotaping hundreds of legal depositions in high profile cases for some of the largest
court reporting and litigation firms in the United States. 
- Writing successful grants totalling more that $100,000 for the Jersey City Free Public
Library
