BikeCycle's purpose is to track the lifecycle of a bicycle through FreeRide from the time a bicycle is first donated, to when it leaves the shop. FreeRide FreeRide accepts donated bicycles in any condition. Volunteers evaluate the bikes, fix them, donate them, or take them apart for metal recycling. Once a bike is fixed, it's donated or sold to the public at a drastically reduced price. Current Spreadsheets FreeRide currently uses two speadsheets to record bicycle information, an Incoming spreadsheet and an Outgoing spreadsheet. Incoming spreadsheet: When a bike is donated to the shop a unique number, known as the bikeID, is pasted to the frame. The bikeID and other basic information are entered into a form which automatically populates a spreadsheet named Incoming. An abbreviated example of the Incoming spreadsheet is below: Incoming Timestamp Make Model Wheel Size Bike ID 7/29/2022 10:12:14 Kent Ambush 20\" A0001 7/29/2022 10:12:54 Huffy Stone Mountain 20\" A0002 7/29/2022 10:13:32 Next Screamer II 20\" A0003 Outgoing spreadsheet: When a bicycle leaves the shop through a donation, sales, or recycling, the bikeID and destination are recorded using a form that populates a spreadsheet named Outgoing. Outgoing Bike ID Outgoing Destination A0069 Volunteer A0301 Sold A0302 Communicycle Proposed Spreadsheet BikeCycle spreadsheet: I was asked to take the two existing spreadsheets, Incoming and Outgoing, and create a third spreadsheet named BikeCycle. The BikeCycle spreadsheet links the Incoming spreadsheet to the Outgoing spreadsheet using the bikeID. When a bike is leaving the shop and the bikeID is entered into the Outgoing form, the information associated with that bikeID, that was captured on the Incoming spreadsheet, will automatically show up in the new BikeCycle spreadsheet. This will allow the user to see all the data for that bike in one place. BikeCycle Bike Id Outgoing Destination Incoming Timestamp Make Model Wheel Size A0069 Volunteer 7/29/2022 10:12:14 Kent Ambush 20\" A0069 Volunteer 7/29/2022 10:12:54 Huffy Stone Mountain 20\" A0069 Volunteer 7/29/2022 10:13:32 Next Screamer II 20\" The Challenges There were a few challenges to overcome to complete this project. The two original sheets are in seperate files. The lookup column in the Incoming spreadsheet, BikeId, is not the first column in the sheet. This presents challenges for the common spreadsheet formula VLOOKUP() which requires the lookup field be to the left of any fields returned by the search. Note: There are other spreadsheet options that can be used, but this is a showcase of my VLOOKUP() skills. Other options include: INDEX() / MATCH() QUERY() XLOOKUP() Add-ons such as Consolidate Sheets or Merge Sheets The Solution The solution to this challenge, using VLOOKUP(), is to use a combination of IMPORTRANGE() and VLOOKUP() in a new spreadsheet. IMPORTRANGE() is used to import the Outgoing data (Date, BikeId, Destination) to the BikeCycle spreadsheet. VLOOKUP() uses the bikeID to search for the corresponding bicycle attributes in the Incoming spreadsheet. Let's take a look at how we got around the VLOOKUP() limitation that requires the lookup field to be in the left most column. If you remember, the bikeId on the Incoming spreadsheet occurs well into the spreadsheet column list and definitely not to the left of the information we want VLOOKUP() to return. Incoming Timestamp Make Model Wheel Size Bike ID 7/29/2022 10:12:14 Kent Ambush 20\" A0001 Solution formula To avoid the limitations of VLOOKUP() we use the following formula to trick it into using the bikeId which is not the left most column. In place of a standard spreadsheet range A1:J , we use an array to rearrange the column order {Incoming!H2,Incoming!A2:J} . Here's the formula in it's entirety: ArrayFormula(IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A2,{Incoming!H2,Incoming!A2:J},{2,3,4,5,6,7,9},False),\"\")) Don't panic! We're going to deconstruct this formula into it's individual parts and explain what each part is doing. Deconstruction This combination of three predefined spreadsheet formulas uses ArrayFormula(), IFERROR(), and VLOOKUP() together to get the desired results. VLOOKUP() First, let's highlight the VLOOKUP() part of this formula. ArrayFormula(IFERROR( VLOOKUP(A2,{Incoming!H2,Incoming!A2:J},{2,3,4,5,6,7,9},False) ,\"\")) Next we look at the VLOOKUP() syntax and compare it to the VLOOKUP() in our formula. The Microsoft documentation for Excel defines the syntax for VLOOKUP() as: VLOOKUP(lookup_value,table_array,col_index_num,[range_lookup]) In the syntax above, the lookup_value is the search term we are trying to find. The table_array is where we expect to find this term and it's related values. The col_index_num is the column or columns we want to return. The [range_lookup] is optional and specifies whether the lookup value should be an exact match (FALSE or 0) or approximate match (TRUE or 1 [ to work properly the columm must be sorted in ascending order]). The table below gives a description of this syntax and shows the values we entered for each part. VLOOKUP() lookup_value table_array col_index_num [range_lookup] Description search value range to search which columns to return FALSE = approx match, TRUE = exact match Our version A2 {Incoming!H2,Incoming!A2:J} {2,3,4,5,6,7,9} False So how does this particular call to VLOOKUP() get around the limitaion that requires the search match field to be in the left most column? Let's examine at the values in the table _array , which is the range we give VLOOKUP() to use in it's search. VLOOKUP(A2, {Incoming!H2,Incoming!A2:J} ,{2,3,4,5,6,7,9},False) ,\"\"))``` In our call to VLOOKUP(), in the table_array values are {Incoming!H2,Incoming!A2:J} . In a typical VLOOKUP() call, we would put a column and row range here. It would be something like A1:J to basically have VLOOKUP() search all the columns and rows in our sheet. Searching the whole range A1:J doesn't work for us because the BikeID, which is our lookup value, is not in the left most column. Instead we create our own defined range using an array , which starts and ends in curly braces {}. Our Array We use an array to mimic a speadsheet range. Inside our array, we can put the columns in any order we like. more to come... To recap: The winning formula with the VLOOKUP() portion highlighted: ArrayFormula(IFERROR( VLOOKUP(A2,{Incoming!H2,Incoming!A2:J},{2,3,4,5,6,7,9},False) ,\"\")) You can learn more about VLOOKUP() here","title":"BikeCycle"},{"location":"bikecycle/#purpose","text":"BikeCycle is a Google Sheets based bicycle tracking system for FreeRide, a Do-It-Yourself bicycle cooperative located in Pittsburgh PA.
